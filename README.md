# timetable-using-html-css

/* What is the project */
This project is about creating a static timetable as in the structure of Excel cells using html and css.

/* Why is this project created */
To show the possibility that the existing structures can be recreated using other tools than the original excel. 
And this can be shared as a web file rather than being an excel file.
I personally created this design to try the accessibility of the design and also you can increase or decrease the cell size , cell content , color , etc.

/* Syntax Used */
<td> - to assign values as cell style
<tr> - In this syntax the structure of the cell , cell size , content , color , etc. are given .
